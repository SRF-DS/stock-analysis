Module 2.1 - 2.3

Module 2.1
Overview
In today's class, you’ll be introduced to fundamental programming with VBA, including foundational concepts like variables, arrays, and conditionals. This lesson will lay the groundwork for you to explore Python and JavaScript in upcoming modules.

What You'll Learn
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

Define the building blocks of all programming languages: variables, arrays, conditionals, loops, and functions.

Create simple VBA macros to trigger pop-ups and change cell values.

Write VBA subroutines that use variables and conditionals.

Practice essential coding skills, including syntax recollection, pattern recognition, problem decomposition, and debugging.

Module 2.2
Overview
Now that you have an understanding of VBA basics, you can start writing more complex code to perform your analyses. In this lesson, you’ll learn how to use basic and nested for loops together with conditionals to perform common coding tasks in VBA. Let’s get started!

What You'll Learn
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

Describe the basic syntax of a VBA for loop.

Direct logic flow by using for loops and conditionals.

List the benefits of using nested for loops.

Explain the basic process of using nested for loops.

Comprehend fundamental coding skills, including syntax recollection, pattern recognition, problem decomposition, and debugging.

Module 2.3
Overview
This lesson will conclude your in-depth exploration of VBA scripting, formatting, and loops. First, you will take a deep dive into formatting spreadsheets with VBA code. Then, during the second half of class, you will work in small groups to create a VBA script that takes an Excel workbook with multiple sheets of U.S. Census data, formats each sheet to improve readability, and then combines all of the data into a single table.

What You'll Learn
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

Format spreadsheets with VBA code.

Loop through a table with VBA code and check for changes in values.
